# Driver
React.js based project for mobiles only. Yet within mobiles totally RWD. Site based on a UX/UI design amended to my more minimalistic and black&white preferences. The project is more about my RWD and React training, not a functionality itself. Yet an idea of it is to provide car drivers with handy app to improve their road skills.
